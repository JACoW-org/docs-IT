A final quality check is needed, task that normally needs to browse through all the papers and pages to spot any possible last-minute issue that could have been introduced by the editing process. Re-doing this visual check for every new version of the proceedings is frustrating and time consuming. Using automatic tools that analyse two PDFs and highlight differences can speed up a lot this task.  Acrobat Pro has a very useful function to Compare PDFs, which can also produce a report about the differences. This can be very useful for an editor, however it doesn't scale well with large documents like the final proceedings. It just can't handle those big documents.</p> <p>Various other tools have been found and some of them tested and used.
