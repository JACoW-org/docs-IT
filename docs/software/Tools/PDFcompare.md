# PDF comparison tools

![](img/PDFcomparison.png)

The Editor-in-Chief usually needs to iterate through **various versions of the final proceedings**. A **final quality check** is needed, task that normally needs to browse through all the papers and pages to spot any possible last-minute issue that could have been introduced by the editing process.
Re-doing this visual check for every new version of the proceedings is frustrating and time consuming. Using **automatic tools that analyse two PDFs** and highlight differences can speed up a lot this task. 
Acrobat Pro has a very useful function to Compare PDFs, which can also produce a report about the differences. This can be very useful for an editor, however it doesn't scale well with large documents like the final proceedings. It just can't handle those big documents.

Various other tools have been found and some of them tested and used. The following table enlists what can be used by a JACoW Editor-in-Chief, starting from the tools that proved to be more promising for our needs.

This option is recommended because you can compare different versions of the same file, having highlights at every change. So, your files will open up next to each other showing all the differences between one and another. <br><br>Another option is to use the _Side By Side View_ feature from _View Module_ that allows you to simply open up two files next to each other.
