## General Requirements

- **Language:** All software must be installed at least with English language support
- **Version policy:** Use "latest stable version available" unless otherwise specified by JACoW
- **Critical:** Ensure all patches are installed

Software requirements depend on the context. Examples include:

## Which Software in which Context

You could setup the different rooms and locations with different sets of software, it might save you some licensing cost, but it will add a considerable amount of work to configure different setups.

We strongly suggest not to create too many setups across your conference workstations.

If you go for example for two setups you should consider one with all the features and one that is quite bare.

"Maximum" (Paper and Presentation Processing) setup has everything, and you will basically use it where a team member is "working".

"Minimum" (Browsing / Reading) setup might be used for different reasons everywhere in a more "Kiosk"-like environment. You might add software to the minimal setup individually "on site" where it seems necessary.

## Setup Strategy

- **Large conferences:** [Set up a "master" computer and clone other systems](multipleworkstations.md)
- **Small conferences (4-6 PCs):** Manual setup may be more practical than having the cloning overhead
