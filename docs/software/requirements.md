## Which Software in which Context

You could setup the different contexts with different sets of software, but it will add a considerable amount of work to configure different setups.

This talk highlights what sofware is needed in which context, but we strongly suggest not to create too many setups you use accross your conference workstations.

If you go for two setups you should consider one with all the features and one that is quite bare.

    "Maximum" (Paper and Presentation Processing) setup has everything, and you will basically use it where a team member is "working".
    "Minimum" (Browsing / Reading) setup might be used for different reasons everywhere in a more "Kiosk"-like environment. You might add software to the minimal setup individually "on site" where it seems necessary (e.g. LaTeX software and Word for authors to update their papers).
