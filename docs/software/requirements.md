# Software Requirements

@TODO Merge this page with [Computer Setup Guide](../software/software.md#standard-base-software) or completly remove this explanatory information? Or should we move / keep more of the explanatory stuff in the wiki. 

Software requirements depend on the use context. Examples include:

| Function | Where? |
| -------- | ------- |
| Browsing / Reading<br>(Checking e-mails, signing up for things online and viewing documents) | Business Office<br>Dot Board<br>Satellite Meetings |
| Forms / Printing<br>(Working with forms, payments, etc.) | Registration<br>Author Reception |
| Paper and Presentation Authoring<br>(Authors work on papers and presentations) | Business Office<br>Auditorium(s) |
| Paper and Presentation Processing<br>(Editors work on papers and presentations) | Proceedings Office<br>Speaker Preparation<br>1 PC at Author Reception | 

## Which Software in which Context

You could setup the different rooms and locations with different sets of software, it might save you some licensing cost, but it will add a considerable amount of work to configure different setups.

This talk highlights what sofware is needed in which context, but we strongly suggest not to create too many setups accross your conference workstations.

If you go for two setups you should consider one with all the features and one that is quite bare.

"Maximum" (Paper and Presentation Processing) setup has everything, and you will basically use it where a team member is "working".

"Minimum" (Browsing / Reading) setup might be used for different reasons everywhere in a more "Kiosk"-like environment. You might add software to the minimal setup individually "on site" where it seems necessary (e.g. LaTeX software and Word for authors to update their papers).

The table below tries to give an idea which software will be used for which purpose, for details on software setup check the [Computer Setup Guide](../software/software.md#standard-base-software)
