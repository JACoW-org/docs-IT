# Backup System

While your editors are working at the conference venue you want to do regular backups (e.g. every evening) of their work in case a workstation fails.

For small conferences you can use a windows share on one of your machines and backup the other data to it. Windows shares are usually limit to 15 connections (if it is not enterprise windows) so this only works if you have fewer than 15 workstations.

For conferences with more workstations you should think about a dedicated system (e.g. one computer with FreeNAS on it) to backup the data on a daily basis.
