# Space Planning

Layouts should be created for all IT spaces. Layouts can be created, for example, with Sweet Home 3D (free interior design application) and laid out to provide plenty of space for editors and ergonomic workspaces.

This way you will also catch early problematic setups with e.g. cabling or passage ways. And if you adjust the models properly even if you have the correct amount of e.g. tables available / rented.
