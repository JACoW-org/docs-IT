# Hardware

Hardware requirements are nothing static, so we maintain this page with our current recommendations.

## Typical Hardware Requirements (Counts)

Depending on your conference size you will find yourself on the lower or higher end of the given ranges on the following list.

    Proceedings Office
        5 - 20 Computers
        1 - 2 Printers 
    Author Reception
        2 - 5 Computers 
    Internet Cafe
        10 - 20 Computers
        Laptop Spaces 
    Business Office
        2 - 5 computers
        1 Multi-Function Printer 
    Presentation Management / Speaker Preparation
        PC and Mac Support
        Computer setup should be identical to the Auditorim to have no suprises (e.g. software, screen resolution, etc.)
        2 - 4 Windows and 1 Mac Laptop 
    Auditorium(s)
        1 PC and Mac support for each auditorium
        1 Spare for each on-hand
        1 Timer for each auditorium 
    Registration
        1 - 2 Laptops 
    Satellite Meetings
        Laptop and Projector as needed 
    Dot Board
        Laptop and Large Screen
        1 - 3 Typical 


For example for the author reception we have a a simple "rule of thumb" -- per 250 participants:

    1 computer for the counter
    1 computer for staff member who has answerability to make editorial decisions. It is important to have this second machine set up, keeping the counter machine free for author reception.
    SPMS system: the Author Reception staff require the Sort/File/Edit privilege in Roles and Responsibilities.
    The computer on the counter has a single use, the only software requirement is that of a browser window to access the SPMS system. 

As the amount of participants increase, dedicated tasks need to be introduced.

    small conference = <250 participants
        2 computers (1 for counter, 1 for Room Coordinator) 
    medium conference = 250-500 participants
        3 computers (2 for counter, 1 for Room Coordinator) 
    medium/large conference = 500-1000 participants
        3-5 computers (3-4 on counter, 1 for Room Coordinator) 
    large conference = >1000 participants
        5 computers (4 on counter, 1 for Room Coordinator) 

## Buying vs. Renting (Quotes)

    IPAC'15 (large, 20+ editors):
        Purchasing instead of renting worked very well
            Chosen hardware was very good
            Allowed plenty of time for configuration
            Spares were readily available (except monitors and power cords!) 
    IPAC'16 (large, 20+ editors):
        Hiring rental company can save a lot of labor
            It was slightly costly
            They did all the setup including power, network, updates etc. 
    IBIC'16 (medium, 6 editors):
        Renting finally worked fine.
            The IT setup in all the PCs is not as slow as thought
            The process of installing the bundle and setup the software is not a big deal
            If you can do it in parallel with some people it is fast and smooth.
