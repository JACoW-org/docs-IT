# Font Installation

We need some particular fonts for our editing. In detail:

1. Barcode font to print the papers at the proceedings office

2. Embeddable symbol font

3. Liberation Mono for the URLs and DOIs (Word)

The first two are available in the [AcrobatPitStopTools](https://github.com/JACoW-org/AcrobatPitStopTools), the latter on Download the fonts from the [Free Best Fonts](https://www.freebestfonts.com/liberation-mono-font) website.

To install them select all font files, right-click and select `Install for all users`:
