This site hosts the documentation about the IT tools and their configuration for JACoW conferences.

## Why Should IT Be Near Perfect?

The IT ...

* ... is the foundation of the conference
* ... enables editors, speaker preparation, author reception, registration and others to work. The better the IT the more efficient the job they will do and this impacts the conference and proceedings
* ... is a major component of the budget
* ... is one of the main factors that drives the perception about success of a conference 

## An up front Advice for Future Planners

* Don't expect to get anything done at your regular job starting about a month before the conference!
* You will end up investigating and doing a lot more than just IT!
* Learn from lessons from the past!
    * Send as many people to as many conferences as you can to investigate. 
    * Be Flexible!
        * Don't think the requirements of your conference will exactly be the same as the last one. 
    * Bring extra:
        * Power strips
        * Extension Cords
        * Monitors
        * Stock up on sleep 
    * Plan on spending lots and lots of time with the network staff beforehand (lab and venue).
    * Draft intelligent dedicated people as early in the process as you can. You can't do it alone. Bring as many as they will allow you.
