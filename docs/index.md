## Why Should IT Be Near Perfect?

IT plays a crucial role in conference success because it:

- **Foundation of the conference** - Forms the basic infrastructure everything else depends on
- **Enables editors to work** - The better the IT, the more efficient editors become, directly impacting proceedings quality
- **Major budget component** - Represents a significant portion of conference expenses
- **Drives perception** - One of the key factors influencing attendees' perception of conference success

## An up front Advice for Future Planners

### Time Management

- **Don't expect regular work productivity** starting one month before conference
- **Expect expanded scope** - you'll investigate and handle much more than just IT

### Learning and Preparation

- **Learn from past conferences** - study lessons learned documentation
- **Send people to conferences** - attend as many conferences as possible for experience
- **Train speaker managers** - send at least one person to gain speaker preparation experience

### Flexibility and Planning

- **Stay flexible** - each conference has unique requirements
- **Draft experienced people early** - you cannot handle everything alone
- **Bring extra supplies:**
    - Power strips
    - Extension cords  
    - Monitors
- **Stock up on sleep** before the conference
- **Plan extensive venue networking discussions** beforehand

### Staffing

- Having experienced people in Speaker Preparation ensures smooth operations
- Recruit intelligent, dedicated people as early as possible
- Bring as many qualified staff as budget allows
